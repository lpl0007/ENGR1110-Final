## Team Members:
- [Logan Schmidt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-schmidt234/)
- Canon Shaw
- Mason Stokes
- Paul Weidle

## Overview
A team project is an integral part of ENGR 1110 and it is designed to enable each member of the team to:

- Apply Python programming skills
- Learn to work within the context of an authentic software process similar to one used in industry
- Develop teamwork skills
- Develop written and oral communication skills
- Develop the ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies
- Learn presentation skills and the use of organizational tools
The theme for this semesterâ€™s project is *Visualizing Global Issues*. Working in a team of four to six students, you are required to propose, design, implement, and deliver a data visualization and analytics project to address real-world problems. The visualizations and analytics elements can be embedded in a software user interface that your team builds, or they can be embedded within reports and presentations you create with general tools such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, Google Docs and Slides, and other options.

The project must address a real-world problem such as:
- **Poverty**
  - Analyze data on poverty rates, income inequality, and access to basic necessities to understand the challenges faced by different populations.
- **Climate Change**
  - Use data on temperature, carbon emissions, and sea-level rise to visualize the impact of climate change on different regions of the world.
- **Healthcare**
  - Explore data on healthcare expenditure, disease prevalence, and access to medical facilities to identify areas that may need intervention.

Here are a few freely accessible datasets that you may find useful.

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [data.world](https://data.world/product/community/)
- [Data.gov](https://data.gov/)
- [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)

The use of materials (datasets, images, text, visuals, etc.) not created by your team must be properly attributed and comply with all copyright laws.

## Useful Python Libraries
**Data Visualization**
- The matplotlib library provides powerful tools for visualizing data. By creating various types of charts such as line plots, bar graphs, scatter plots, and heatmaps, we can more effectively convey the information present in a dataset. Visualizations can help in identifying trends, patterns, and outliers, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of the issues characterized by the data. See Chapter 11 of the course zyBook for information on using matplotlib.

**Trend Analysis and Statistics**
- The numpy library offers a a range of functionalities that can be used to identify trends, patterns and statistics, within the datasets. By applying statistical methods such as mean, median, standard, deviation, and correlation, we can gain insights into the relationships between different variables. Trend analysis and statistics provide valuable information to support decision-making and propose actionable steps to make a difference. See Chapter 11 of the course zyBook for information on using numpy.

## Project Scope and Requirements
Your project must meet the following minimum requirements:
- Use Python 3 and an appropriate package such as Matplotlib, NumPy, or Pandas.
- Use a real-world dataset.
- Create visualizations and analysis from Python code.
- Visualize data in a meaningful way (identify patterns/trends, provide interactive visuals).

Your project must contain narrative elements that:
- Define the global issue being addressed.
- Describe the data collection process.
- Describe the process of data exploration and building the visualization.
- Provide the message / story that is being communicated through the visualizations.
- Identify actions that could be taken to address the identified issue. This may involve raising awareness, advocating for policy changes, supporting organizations working in the area, or developing innovative solutions.

Beyond these basic requirements we want you to exercise your creativity - choose something that excites you! Impress us!
